      <h3>About me</h3>
      <section class="description">
              <p class="hello-there-i-m">
                Hello there! I'm Minola Stanciu, a spirited soul who finds her bliss in the intersection of travel,
                art, and nature's wonders. Embarking on new adventures is my forte, as I capture the essence of my
                journeys through the strokes of my artistic expression. Among the myriad of flowers, my heart resonates
                most with the elegance of tulips, their delicate beauty a constant source of inspiration for me.
              </p>

              <p class="when-i-m-not">
                When I'm not wandering through new landscapes or immersed in my art, you can find me passionately
                contributing to my university's student organization. Volunteering there is my way of giving back
                and fostering a sense of community among fellow students. I believe in the strength of collaboration and
                the significance of cultivating a vibrant and inclusive campus environment.

              <p class="whether-i-m">
                Whether I'm sketching the charm of a city, tending to my beloved tulips, or dedicating my time to
                student initiatives, each moment is a canvas waiting to be painted with the colors of life. Join me on
                my journey, where the love for travel, art, and the beauty of giving back converge into a tapestry of
                meaningful experiences.
